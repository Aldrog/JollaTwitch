TwitchTube
==========

Twitch.tv client for Sailfish OS.

Video playback has serious issues because Sailfish currently uses deprecated GStreamer 0.10. It should switch to gst 1.0 not later then 2.0 update.

Features
--------
- Navigating by game
- Viewing top channels
- Browse followed channels and games
- Following and unfollowing channels and games
- Search channels
- Chat

State of development
--------------------
1.0 roadmap has been completed and now the app only requires some polishing (adjusting opacity levels of items on multitasking cover as an example).
The app will be updated (and most likely published in Jolla Store) as soon as GStreamer 1.0 based multimedia stack is available in Sailfish.

Future plans
------------
Version 1.0 doesn't mean the development of the app is over. After release I will start adding new features like:
- Tablet interface
- Viewing channel's biography
- Watching past broadcasts
