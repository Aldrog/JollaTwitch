TwitchTube
==========

Twitch.tv client for Jolla.

What works
----------
- Navigating by game
- Top channels
- Search channels
- Browse followed channels
- Chat

Video should work but I can't be sure as it doesn't work either on an emulator or on my Galaxy S3 (thanks rusty88 from xda-developers.com for porting).

TODO
----
- Improve followings page
- Improve settings page
- Add broadcast titles (maybe optional, like in android version)
- Rework pulley menu on stream page
- Colorful nicknames in chat
- Joins and parts processing
- Move settings to QSettings usage
